  To extract the time value, we use the split() method on the output string. The first split() operation is output.split("Average ="), which splits the string at the substring "Average =". This will result in a list with two elements: the part before "Average =" and the part after "Average =". We are interested in the part after "Average =", so we access it by using [1].

  The next split() operation is split("ms"). We split the second part of the string obtained in the previous step at the substring "ms". This will give us a list with two elements: the time value and the part after "ms". We are interested in the time value, so we access it by using [0].
